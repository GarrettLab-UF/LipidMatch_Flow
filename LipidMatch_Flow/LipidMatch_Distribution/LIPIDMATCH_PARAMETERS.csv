Parameters,Values,Notes
RT Window (for matching peaks to MS/MS scans),0.14,0.14 would be RT plus or minus 0.07 minute search window (can be seconds as well if that is what units are in)
MZ Search Tolerance MS1 (Da),0.005,0.005 would be MZ plus or minus 0.005 Da search window
MZ Search Window MS2 (ppm),10,10 would be MZ plus or minus 5 ppm search window
Isolation Window (selection accuracy),1,amu or Da. 1 would be MZ plus or minus 0.5
Minimum Scans for Fragment,1,Minimum number of scan with a fragment observed for that fragment to be considered real
Intensity Threshold MS2,1000,Necessary for a fragment mass to be considered real
AIF minimum number of scans,5,Minimum number of scan with a fragment observed for that fragment to be considered real
AIF correlation cutoff,0.6,Adjusted R2 correlation between precursors and fragments
